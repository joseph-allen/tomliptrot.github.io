As not everybody knows what that data science is, I wanted to write a post with my take on it. I'll give a few widely accepted definitions and my thoughts on how these are changing. It is still a relatively new field and is still rapidly evolving. Often discussion on this topic are kicked off with at least one Venn diagram like the one below:

### History

This diagram was [made](http://drewconway.com/zia/2013/3/26/the-data-science-venn-diagram) by New-York Based data scientist Drew Conway in 2010. It is supposed to represent the three core sets of skills that make up the discipline:

- Hacking skills - skills in coding and software development, particularly around handling big datasets
- Maths And statistics knowledge - particularly around machine learning algorithms but covering many aspects of applied maths and statistics
- Substantive expertise - This term is a bit vague, but basically means some knowledge about the context of the data

According to Conway, and others since, somebody with some combination all three of these skill could be a data scientist.

At the time this diagram was made there were only  handful of people with the job title 'Data Scientist' in the world, they mostly existed at the big internet companies in the  USA. Over the past eight years their number has increased and the job has evolved.

### Present

I have some issues with that description. It is more a description of a set of skills than a definition of a profession. We don't describe astrophysics as '*the intersection of maths skills, telescopes and physics*' it is '*the branch of astronomy concerned with the physical nature of stars and other celestial bodies*'. Likewise medicine is not '*the intersection of biology, chemistry and people*' or whatever but is '*the science or practice of the diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of disease*'. A better description of data science would  describe the scope and nature of its pursuit.

Working definition: *The practice of using electronic data and mathematical techniques to give prescriptions or predictions in human organisations*.[ref to domino]

Contrast with other fields:
- Statistics (tends to retrospective and concerned with quantifying uncertainty)
- Business Intelligence & analytics (tends to be retrospective and concerned accurately quantifying  and presenting business data)
- Software development (tends to be prospective - designing and building tool for users)
- Machine Learning
- Artifical Intelligence

### Future

Data science, AI and machine learning are undoubtedly at some part of a hype cycle at the moment. It is certanly possible that we are reaching the Peak of inflated Expectations, some people have probably already been through the trough of dissalusionment, and some may be nearing the platuea of prodvtivity. As William Gibson said: "*The future is already here â€” it's just not very evenly distributed*".
