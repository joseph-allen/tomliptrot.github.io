I am a data scientist, and as not everybody  knows what that it, I thought  it  would be useful to write a post clearing things up. It is still a relatively new discipline and is rapidly evolving. There is some confusion over what exactly it is and normally these discussions are kicked off with at least one Venn diagram like the one below:

![DS Venn Diagram](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5150aec6e4b0e340ec52710a/t/51525c33e4b0b3e0d10f77ab/1364352052403/Data_Science_VD.png){: .center-image }

### History

This diagram was first made by New York Based data scientist Drew Conway in 2010.It is supposed to represent the three core sets of skills that make up a data scientist:
- Hacking skills - skills in coding and software development, particularly around handling big datasets
- Maths And Statistics Knowledge
- Substantive Expertise

The intersection of all three of these skill is a data scientist

At tehTime tis diaram ws made there were only  handful of peope with the job title 'Data Scientist' in the world, they mostly existed at the big internet companies in the  USA
### Present

### Future
