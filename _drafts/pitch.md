## Whats the problem?

- Companies need to make better use of their data
- They don't have the AI and data science skills needed to make the most of it
- They struggle to recruit, retain and make the most of skilled data scientists

## What's the solution?

I will help you identify
Look at a companies objectives
work with senior leader to identify priorities that are achievable with a high impact
Look at their datasets and identify opportunities
scope out those opportunities
For one or two of these: build a proof of concept
make a plan to achieve their objectives
help them to complex the plan by:
 - doing some of the work
 - Training and mentoring existing staff
 - helping to hire, train and mentor new data scientists
 - Transfer knowledge and experience into the companies
 - Continue to support and make self sufficient

## For investors

Assess a potential investment companies data science and AI capabilities
Suggest possible improvements or enhancements
work with the companies to achieve those improvements

## Marketing strategy
Inbound events and content driven
Outbound to VCs and investors? look into this. Speak to Pete.
