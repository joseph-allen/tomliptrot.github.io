## What's the problem?

- Companies need to make better use of their data
- They don't have the AI and data science skills needed to make the most of it
- They struggle to recruit, retain and make the most of data scientists

## What's the solution?

I can help you build an internal data science capability that is self-sustaining and high-achieving.
I will work with your company to identify ways that data science and AI could solve your problems
I will suggest changes that can make you a high performing data driven company
I will assess exactly what needs to be done, how long it will take and how likely it is to work
I will assess the likely impact of the solution

After this point I can:
Build a proof of concept that shows how a solution would look
Make a plan to achieve the full objectives

I will help you to achieve the plan by:
 - Training and mentoring existing staff
 - Helping to hire, train and mentor new data scientists
 - Transfer knowledge and experience into your company
 - Providing continuing support and advice

## For investors

Assess a potential investment companies data science and AI capabilities
Suggest possible improvements or enhancements
work with the companies to achieve those improvements

## Marketing strategy
Inbound events and content driven
Outbound to VCs and investors? look into this. Speak to Pete.
