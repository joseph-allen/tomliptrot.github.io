I have just been to the [Data Summit](https://www.datafest.global/data-summit) in Edinburgh, It was a really good event. Here are some of my thoughts following it.

### Day One

### Christopher Wylie

This is the guy who [blew the whistle on Cambridge Analytica](https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/mar/17/data-war-whistleblower-christopher-wylie-faceook-nix-bannon-trump). Wonderfully candid and blunt. Great speaker: intense but genuine. It's a story we've heard before but it was great to hear from such an insider.
Some highlights:
- On Nick Clegg after breaking the Lib Dems tuition fees pledge: *"Nick Clegg Likes to sell out his values: Now he's at Facebook - surprise surprise"*
- On the tech he worked on for the US and UK military: "*A weapon doesn't have to be a gun - it can be information*"
- On their use: "*Weapons designed for attacking Isis and Boko Haram were being deployed against voters in the US and UK*"
- On the take over of Cambridge Analytica by [Robert Mercer](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/03/27/the-reclusive-hedge-fund-tycoon-behind-the-trump-presidency): "*Suddenly there was a research team staffed by Russians from the FSB (the Russian security service) walking around*"
- On making a complaint internally: "*It wasn't like I could just go to HR and say - everything you are doing is against the law*"
- On Breibart news [*"It's for straight white guys who can't get laid*"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incel)
- Describing Cambridge Analytica to a Guardian journalist for the first time: "*The steal data and manipulate people*"
- On Facebook: "*They care more about their share price than about preserving democracy*"

Despite the terrible tales he told he did have some constructive suggestions: We need design and safety standards for the internet. Big Tech should be regulated like a utility. Tech companies make addictive products that cause harm and are now essential to our way of life. The should be regulated by technical bodies in the same way as buildings, medicine and airlines.


### Day Two
