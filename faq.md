## What is Machine Learning?



## What is Artificial Intelligence?

Artificial Intelligence is a slippery, often misused term. However, i will attempt to describe it. In machine learning there are two types of problems: things computers are good at that people find easy, and things people find easy but computers are good at.

### 1) Things computers are good at that people find hard

- Numerical calculations involving millions of numbers
- Storing tabular datasets
- Linear models (???)

### 2) Things people are good at but computers find hard

- Communicating with other people
- blha
- blah

### 3) Things people find hard and computers find hard

- blah
- blah
- blah

What type of things go on each of these lists varies over time, and quite often artificial intelligence is simply defined as the things computers can't do yet. Chess and Go used to be on list 3) but are now on list 1)

## How can these things help my business?
