On Tuesday I spoke at [CRAP Talks MCR](https://www.meetup.com/CRAP-Talks-CRO-Analytics-Product-Manchester/events/264130129/). CRAP is a snappily titled meetup about 'Conversion Rate, Analytics and Product'. There was a range of people in attendance mostly working either in e-commerce or digital agencies. I'd been once before an I liked the range of topics and mix of people there: a bit off my usual machine learning and data science beat.

There first talk was a really interesting one about Intelligent Tracking Protection (ITP) and its impacts on the internet by [Liam Galliers](https://www.linkedin.com/in/liam-galliers-87b04269) from (Code Computerlove)[https://www.codecomputerlove.com/]. For those who haven't heard of this (like me), it is an attempt to stop excessively intrusive tracking by Apple and webkit, and is part of a battle between various internet giants (apple vs facebook and google) for the future of the internet. ITP is going to make quite a big impact on attempts to improve websites through things like A/B testing, at least for the 13% or so who use the safari browser.

The last talk was about CRAP at [Matalan](https://www.matalan.co.uk/) by [Jack Osborne](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jack-osborne-0061a468/?originalSubdomain=uk). A really good overview of how digital analytics can lie at the centre of an organisation. For me, as a bit of an outsider, this was useful for seeing how these things work in an organisation.

Thanks to [Becky Lacock](https://www.linkedin.com/in/becky-lacock-19bb33b9/) for organising a great event.

## My talk

My talk was a slightly updated version of the machine learning 101 talk I've given a couple of times. I stripped it back a bit and added some animated gifs to illustrate how a simple linear model gets trained. The audio and slides are below. After the talk, somebody asked about good resources for learning about machine learning for the beginner. Here are a few:
* [Prediction Machines](https://www.predictionmachines.ai) by economists Ajay Agrawal, Joshua Gans and Avi Goldfarb. I liked this books non sensationalist and fairly accurate portrayal of how machine learning can be used in business
* [Hello World: How to be Human in the Age of the Machine](https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B0785PY2Q4/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&btkr=1) by Hannah Fry. I haven't actually read this book yet, but I really like Hannah Fry and the blurb and extracts seem good.
* A slightly bigger time commitment is Andrew Ng's hugely popular online [machine learning course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning).
* Another, fairly technical book, that I like is [An Introduction to Statistical Learning](http://faculty.marshall.usc.edu/gareth-james/ISL/)
