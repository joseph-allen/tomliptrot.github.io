title: The U.S. has artificial intelligence competition all wrong
---

AI competition is about data, algorithms and compute power. This [article](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/united-states/2020-08-07/us-has-ai-competition-all-wrong) argues that compute power is the most important of those.

> Recognizing the true power of compute would mean reassessing the state of global AI competition. Unlike the other two elements of the triad, compute has undergone a silent revolution led by the United States and its alliesâ€”one that gives these nations a structural advantage over China and other countries that are rich in data but lag in advanced electronics manufacturing. U.S. policymakers can build on this foundation as they seek to maintain their technological edge. 

The article is interesting for its take on AI capabilities as being of such geopolitical importance. Its is also rather depressingly zero-sum in its outlook - which reflects current US foreign policy toward China in particular. I am interested to see how important AI capability becomes over the next decade as these two powers go up against each other.
