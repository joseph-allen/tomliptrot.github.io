Public Health England have released a new [API](https://coronavirus.data.gov.uk/developers-guide) (available for [Python](https://publichealthengland.github.io/coronavirus-dashboard-api-python-sdk/), [JavaScript](https://github.com/publichealthengland/coronavirus-dashboard-api-javascript-sdk), [R](https://github.com/publichealthengland/coronavirus-dashboard-api-R-sdk), [.Net](https://github.com/publichealthengland/coronavirus-dashboard-api-net-sdk) and [Elixir](https://github.com/publichealthengland/coronavirus-dashboard-api-elixir-sdk)) that allows direct access to Coronavirus data. Good news. This should make it easy to play with, interrogate and monitor data.

As flare ups ups continue around the country the ability to access and interpret the data on which decisions are being made is really important. The default portal only provides limited data. I welcome this commitment to making the data open and accessible.
