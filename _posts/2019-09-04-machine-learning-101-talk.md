I gave this talk at the [Barclays AI Eagles Lab](https://labs.uk.barclays/locations/manchester) event on August 30th. The aim was to give a gentle introduction to some ideas of machine learning, using some GCSE (an English age 15 school qualification) maths. Its aimed at people without much ML background and is deliberately fairly simple. I started with a straight line as an example of a very simple mathematical model and built up some ideas about learning from data, non-linearity, and learning functions. I gave some advice on when to use and not use ML and some examples where I have seen things work. It seemed to go down fairly well at the event.

## Audio
I recorded the talk on my phone, the audio isn't perfect but if you are interested you might get the gist of it.
